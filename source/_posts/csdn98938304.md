**Note**: In 1970s, the Dunhuang Academy is established to systematically preserve the heritage. From the study, half of them suffer from corrosion and aging. Because the paintings are created by different artists from 10 centuries, it is non-trivial for manual restoration. And therefore, we release the first Dunhuang Challenge with 600 paintings, which enables an open and public attention in the research community on data driven e-heritage restoration.
This year, the academy is proposing to collaborate with Microsoft Research and other researchers over the world, aiming to solve the automatic restoration of the wall painting using computer vision and machine learning technology.

## **Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge (VisDA-2019)**

[http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2019/](http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2019/)

April 9 - Sept. 27, 2019 // Host by [CodaLab](https://competitions.codalab.org/) & [ICCV 2019](https://eccv2018.org/) // Prize: NaN

**Note**: We are pleased to announce the 2019 Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA2019) Challenge! It is well known that the success of machine learning methods on visual recognition tasks is highly dependent on access to large labeled datasets. Unfortunately, performance often drops significantly when the model is presented with data from a new deployment domain which it did not see in training, a problem known as dataset shift. The VisDA challenge aims to test domain adaptation methods’ ability to transfer source knowledge and adapt it to novel target domains.
This challenge includes two tracks:

## Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Challenge

7月1日-10月23日, 2019 // Host by [DC 竞赛](http://www.dcjingsai.com/) // Prize: 100000

**Note**: 单帧图像超分辨率近年来备受关注。同样的图像，在经过不同超分辨率算法处理后，获得的图像质量也有所不同。在这个挑战中，参赛者需要对100张图片进行4倍超分辨率处理。比赛最终以PI (perceptual index)指标作为评判标准，PI值越小，表明图像质量越高，得分越高，分值高的团队获得优胜。

7月1日-10月23日, 2019 // Host by [DC 竞赛](http://www.dcjingsai.com/) // Prize: 100000

**Note**: 将超分辨算法用于处理实时视频流时，模型的处理表现与运算性能，是一个两难的选择。为了追求较低复杂度，可能需要牺牲图像质量；为了追求较高质量的输出，导致设备资源占用过高，产生设备发烫、视频模糊卡顿等现象。该挑战主要考察算法模型的性能，参赛者需要对图像做2倍的超分辨率处理，算法复杂度控制在1GFLOPs之内，我们以SRCNN模型为baseline, 并采用PSNR、SSIM及运行时间来综合评估算法的性能，分值高者即获胜。

January - December, 2019 // Host by [EvalAI](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/396/overview) // Prize: NaN

**Note**: The Animal-AI Olympics is an AI competition with tests inspired by animal cognition. Participants are given a small environment with just seven different classes of objects that can be placed inside. In each test, the agent needs to retrieve the food in the environment, but to do so there are obstacles to overcome, ramps to climb, boxes to push, and areas that must be avoided. The real challenge is that we don’t provide the tests in advance. It’s up to you to play with the environment and build interesting setups that can help create an agent that understands how the environment’s physics work and the affordances that it has. The final submission should be an agent capable of robust food retrieval behaviour similar to that of many kinds of animals. We know the animals can pass these tests, it’s time to see if AI can too.

Feb 8, 2019 - Apr 26, 2099 // Host by [EvalAI](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/355/) // Prize: NaN

**Note**: Image captioning models have achieved impressive results on datasets containing limited visual concepts and large amounts of paired image-caption training data. However, if these models are to ever function in the wild, a much larger variety of visual concepts must be learned, ideally from less supervision. To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed nocaps, for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the Open Images validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus Open Images imagelevel labels and object bounding boxes. Since Open Images contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work on this task.
