5月24日 - 7月22日, 2019 // Host by [中国信息通信研究院](http://www.industrial-bigdata.com/) // Prize: ￥200,000

**Note**: **第三届工业大数据创新竞赛**
Background: For large rotating machines, due to the high rotating speed and tremendous momentum of the rotor, the centrifugal force may lead to the loose or flying apart of the rotor parts, which brings a great threat to the operation safety of the equipment. This type of fault could lead to high maintenance cost and significant economic loss. The capture of the early symptom of rotor faults is relatively difficult and has become a worldwide challenge in the field of prognostics. It will bring significant safety value and economic benefits if the big data-based methods can detect and predict incipient faults.
赛事简要：大型旋转机组设备高速旋转、动能巨大，转子部件脱落故障给设备安全运行带来巨大威胁。而且这类故障维修成本高、耗时长，早期征兆难以捕捉，是故障预测的世界性难题。如果能通过大数据方法，实现此故障征兆的早期发现和程度预测，将带来显著的安全价值和经济效益。

Feb 8, 2019 - Apr 26, 2099 // Host by [EvalAI](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/355/) // Prize: NaN

**Note**: Image captioning models have achieved impressive results on datasets containing limited visual concepts and large amounts of paired image-caption training data. However, if these models are to ever function in the wild, a much larger variety of visual concepts must be learned, ideally from less supervision. To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed nocaps, for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the Open Images validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus Open Images imagelevel labels and object bounding boxes. Since Open Images contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work on this task.
